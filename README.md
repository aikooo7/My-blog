# My Personal Blog

Welcome to my personal blog! This is where I stare at my computer, write a lot of stuff, and hope that someone sees it. I'm also learning a little bit about Rust â€“ what a win, huh?

Getting more serious now, here's what has been done and what I will eventually add to my blog:

- [ ] Markdown transpilation (Already done but not yet committed because I need to figure out how to fix Tera statements being inside a `<p>` tag.)
- [ ] Syntax highlighting (Will do when I need it.)

**NOTE:** I didn't add common-sense stuff like "MaKe ThIs WoRk" or "SeRvE HtML" because otherwise, I wouldn't even push.
